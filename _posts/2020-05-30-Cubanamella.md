This is my twist on [Cubanamel by TheFogVLOG](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/126323#cubanamel_by_thefogvlog).

I liked the original but I wanted more caramel/vanilla out of it when I was vaping on my Kayfun. So I upped them all by 0.5%

Now it's a thick dark sweet dessert tobacco. 

Goes great with coffee in the morning.

You can use the original TPA Bavarian Cream or the DX. I've tried both and I actually like the DX a little better in this mix.

You should add sweetener to preference.
The original has 0.15% Cap SS, I normally use 0.5% FW Sweetener myself in MTL mixes I want to be very sweet.
